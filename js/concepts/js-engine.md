### JS Engine:

#### 3 Steps:

1. Parsing:
   - JS Engine parses the code and creates an AST(Abstract Sytax Tree).
   - AST is used in Interpreting and Compiling of the Js code.
2. Compiling:
   - JavaScript is both interpreted nd compiled language.
   - JIT is mix of both Interpreter and Compiler.
   - Interpreter executes the code line by line and do not know what will happen in next line.
   - Compiler takes the code optimizes it and converts it into byte code and moves to execution phase.
   - Compilation phase does not assign values to variables. That is done in execution phase by interpreter.
3. Execution:
   - Memory heap:
   - Call Stack:
